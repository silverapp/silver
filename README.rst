Automated tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run Silver automatically you have two choices, although we really recommend the first one. You can either:

* Use Celery (4.x) and setup a celery-beat for the following tasks (recommended):

  * silver.tasks.generate_documents
  * silver.tasks.generate_pdfs
  * silver.tasks.execute_transactions (if making use of silver transactions)
  * silver.tasks.fetch_transactions_status (if making use of silver transactions, for which the payment processor doesn't offer callbacks)

  Requirements:
  Celery-once is used to ensure that tasks are not queued more than once, so you can call them as often as you'd like.
  Redis is required by celery-once, so if you prefer not to use redis, you will have to write your own tasks.

* Setup CRONs which call the following Django commands (e.g. ``./manage.py generate_documents``):

  * generate_documents
  * generate_pdfs
  * execute_transactions (if making use of silver transactions)
  * fetch_transactions_status (if making use of silver transactions, for which the payment processor doesn't offer callbacks)

  You'll have to make sure that each of these commands is not run more than once at a time.
  
Billing documents templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For creating the PDF templates, Silver uses the built-in templating engine of
Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/templates/#the-django-template-language>. 
The template variables that are available in the context of the template are:

    * ``name``
    * ``unit``
    * ``subscription``
    * ``plan``
    * ``provider``
    * ``customer``
    * ``product_code``
    * ``start_date``
    * ``end_date``
    * ``prorated``
    * ``proration_percentage``
    * ``metered_feature``
    * ``context``

For specifying the storage used add the ``SILVER_DOCUMENT_STORAGE`` setting to 
your settings file. Example for storing the PDFs on S3:

.. code-block:: python

    SILVER_DOCUMENT_STORAGE = (
        'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage', [], {
            'bucket': 'THE-AWS-BUCKET',
            'access_key': 'YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY',
            'secret_key': 'YOUR-AWS-SECRET-KEY',
            'acl': 'private',
            'calling_format': 'boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat'
        }
    )
    
Payment Processors settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example for how the PAYMENT_PROCESSORS Django setting should look like, for the Braintree payment processor, from <https://github.com/silverapp/silver-braintree>:

.. code-block:: python

    # put this in your settings.py
    braintree_setup_data = {
        'environment': braintree.Environment.Production,
        'merchant_id': BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID,
        'public_key': BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY,
        'private_key': BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY
    }

    PAYMENT_PROCESSORS = {
        'braintree_triggered': {
            'class': 'silver_braintree.payment_processors.BraintreeTriggered',
            'setup_data': braintree_setup_data,
        },
        'braintree_recurring': {
            'class': 'silver_braintree.payment_processors.BraintreeTriggeredRecurring',
            'setup_data': braintree_setup_data,
        }

Current available payment processors for Silver are:

    * Braintree <https://github.com/silverapp/silver-braintree>
    * PayU RO <https://github.com/silverapp/silver-payu>

Other available settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * ``SILVER_DEFAULT_DUE_DAYS`` - the default number of days until an invoice is due for payment.
    * ``SILVER_DOCUMENT_PREFIX`` - it gets prepended to the path of the saved files.
      The default path of the documents is ``{prefix}{company}/{doc_type}/{date}/{filename}``
    * ``SILVER_PAYMENT_TOKEN_EXPIRATION`` - decides for how long the `pay_url` of a transaction is available, before it needs to be reobtained
    * ``SILVER_AUTOMATICALLY_CREATE_TRANSACTIONS`` - automatically create transactions when a billing document is issued, for recurring payment methods

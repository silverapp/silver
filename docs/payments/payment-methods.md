## Retrieve a specific Payment Method

``` http
GET /customers/<customer_id>/payment_methods/<payment_method_id>/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/1/payment_methods/2/",
    "transactions": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/1/payment_methods/2/transactions/",
    "customer": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/1/",
    "payment_processor": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment_processors/PayPal/",
    "added_at": "2016-12-17T15:11:03.008129Z",
    "verified_at": "2016-12-17T15:11:03.008129Z",
    "state": "enabled"
}
```

## Create a Payment Method

Request:

``` http
POST /customers/<customer_id>/payment_methods/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "payment_processor": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment_processors/PayPal/",
  "state": "unverified",
  "additional_data": {
    "reference": "xoiy6c1b"
  }
}
```

Response:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/1/payment_methods/2/",
    "transactions": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/1/payment_methods/2/transactions/",
    "customer": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/1/",
    "payment_processor": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment_processors/PayPal/",
    "added_at": "2016-12-17T15:11:03.008129Z",
    "verified_at": null,
    "state": "unverified"
}
```

The `additional_data` field can be only specified for payments with `uninitialized` or `unverified` states, when transitioning to a `unverified` or a `enabled` state. The `additional_data` field will be passed to the Payment Processor's `initialize_unverified` or `initialize_enabled` methods.

{
    "state": "enabled",
    "additional_data": {
        "reference": "xoiy6c1b"
    }
}
```

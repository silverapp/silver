* `(string) name`: Display name of the plan.
* `(string) interval = 'month'`: One of `day`, `week`, `month` or `year`. The frequency with which a subscription should be billed.
* `(positive int) interval_count = 1`: The number of intervals (specified in the interval property) between each subscription billing. For example, `interval=month` and `interval_count=3` bills every 3 months.
* `(positive decimal) amount = 0.0000`: The amount in the specified currency to be charged on the interval specified.
* `(string) currency`: Currency in which subscription will be charged.

## Metered feature

A metered feature defines the features that are going to be a part of the plan. E.g.: pageviews, number of downloads, etc. It's a feature of which a number of units can be added during billing cycle. At the end of the billing cycle, it's calculated by multiplying `price_per_unit` and the number of reported units. An example of metered feature is `bandwidth`. A metered feature has the following structure.

* `(string) name`: The feature name.
* `(string) unit`: The metered feature's unit.
* `(positive decimal) price_per_unit = 0.0000`: The price per unit.
* `(positive decimal) included_units = 0.0000`: The number of included units per plan interval.
* `(positive decimal) included_units_during_trial = NULL`: The number of included units during the trial period. If this field is empty, it is considered that all the consumed metered features are free.
* `(ProductCode) product_code`: The product code for this features.

## Subscription

The subscription is one of the main models of the application, as it allows to connect a customer to a plan and it also provides a way for doing the "bookkeeping" operations.

* `(plan) plan`: The plan the customer is subscribed to.
* `(string) description = NULL`: The subscription's description.
* `(string) reference = NULL`: The subscription's reference in an external system.

    * `issued`: The billing document is issued. In this state, the billing document cannot be modified anymore and it's waiting to be either paid or canceled. When switching to this state, the customer's `billing_details` are copied into `billing_details` and `issued_date` is set.
    * `paid`: The billing document has been paid.
    * `canceled`: The billing document has been canceled.

``` none
uninitialized ---> unverified
         \         /
          \       /
           V     V
           enabled <----> disabled
                \         /

## Payment Processor

The base class of a payment processor. Specific payment processors will have to extend this class.
_This is not a Django Model_

* `type (Class constant String, choices=('manual', subclasses-only:['automatic', 'triggered']))`  
   _**manual** - The transactions are initiated by a Silver client. Their status is also verified/managed by a Silver client (e.g admin)._  
   _**triggered** - The transactions are initiated by a Silver client or triggered by a mechanism within Silver. Their status is verified/managed by the Payment Processor._  
   _**automatic** - The transactions are initiated by the real Payment Processor services. Their status are managed by the real Payment Processor services, but are synced in Silver by the Payment Processor class._  

**Methods**:

* `charge_payment(payment, payment_method=None)`  
  _This method will be called whenever the processor should attempt to process the payment using the given payment method._  
  _**Returns** a boolean that describes if the charge attempt was succesful or not._  
* `refund_payment(payment, payment_method=None)`  
* `void_payment(payment, payment_method=None)`  
* `manage_payment(payment)`  

## Processor Manager

Holds a list of all the available [Payment Processors](#payment-processor).

* `processors (Payment Processor list)` - stores the available payment processors.

**Methods**:

* `register(payment_processor, setup_data={})`  
  _Adds the `payment_processor` to the `processors` list and also sets the `status` of that specific Payment Processor Class._  
  _The Payment Processors specified in the Django settings variable `PAYMENT_PROCESSORS` are automatically registered._
* `get(payment_processor_name)`  
  _Returns an instance of the payment processor class or raises a `PaymentProcessorManager.DoesNotExist` exception if the payment processor with that name is not found._  
* `all()`  
  _Returns a list of all the registered Payment Processors._  
* `get_choices()`  
  _Returns choices for the PaymentProcessorField_   

## Transaction

It's the relation between a Document and a Payment Method. It holds the state of the payment processing and it can be used to initiate the payment processing.

* `state (String choices=`[Transaction.State](#transactionstate)`)`: The state of the transaction.
* `payment_method (ForeignKey to `[Payment Method](#payment-method)`)`
* `invoice (ForeignKey to `[Invoice](#invoice)`)`
* `proforma (ForeignKey to `[Invoice](#proforma)`)`
* `amount (Decimal)`: The amount to be charged from the customer. Must be equal (or lower - not yet implemented) to the amount on the document.
* `currency (String choices="pycountry.currencies", default='USD')`: The currency used for billing.
* `currency_rate_date (Date, null)`: The date of the currency rate.
* `uuid (UUID, default=uuid.uuid4)`
* `valid_until (DateTime, null)`
* `last_access (DateTime, null)`
* `disabled (Bool, default=False)`

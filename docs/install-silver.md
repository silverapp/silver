## Installation

To get the latest stable release from PyPi:

```bash
sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
pip install django-silver
```

To get the latest commit from GitHub:

```bash
pip install -e git+git://github.com/silverapp/silver.git#egg=silver
```

Add `silver` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...,
    'silver',
)
```

Add the `silver` URLs to your `urls.py`:

```python
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    url(r'^silver/', include('silver.urls')),
)
```

Don't forget to migrate your database:

```bash
./manage.py migrate silver
```

## Configuration

### Automated tasks

To run Silver automatically you have two choices, although we really
recommend the first one. You can either:

1. Use Celery (4.x) and setup a celery-beat for the following tasks (**recommended**):

    -   silver.tasks.generate\_documents
    -   silver.tasks.generate\_pdfs
    -   silver.tasks.execute\_transactions (if making use of silver
        transactions)
    -   silver.tasks.fetch\_transactions\_status (if making use of
        silver transactions, for which the payment processor doesn't
        offer callbacks)

    > ###### NOTE
    >
    > **Requirements**:
    >
    >- Celery-once is used to ensure that tasks are not
    queued more than once, so you can call them as often as you'd like.
    >- Redis is required by celery-once, so if you prefer not to use Redis,
    you will have to write your own tasks.

2. Setup CRONs which call the following Django commands (e.g.`./manage.py generate_documents`):

    -   generate\_documents
    -   generate\_pdfs
    -   execute\_transactions (if making use of silver transactions)
    -   fetch\_transactions\_status (if making use of silver
        transactions, for which the payment processor doesn't offer
        callbacks)

    You'll have to make sure that each of these commands is not run more
    than once at a time.

### Billing documents templates

For creating the PDF templates, Silver uses the built-in [templating
engine of Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/templates/#the-django-template-language).
The template variables that are available in the context of the template are:

> -   `name`
> -   `unit`
> -   `subscription`
> -   `plan`
> -   `provider`
> -   `customer`
> -   `product_code`
> -   `start_date`
> -   `end_date`
> -   `prorated`
> -   `proration_percentage`
> -   `metered_feature`
> -   `context`

For specifying the storage used add the `SILVER_DOCUMENT_STORAGE`
setting to your settings file. Example for storing the PDFs on S3:

```python
SILVER_DOCUMENT_STORAGE = (
    'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage', [], {
        'bucket': 'THE-AWS-BUCKET',
        'access_key': 'YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY',
        'secret_key': 'YOUR-AWS-SECRET-KEY',
        'acl': 'private',
        'calling_format': 'boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat'
    }
)
```

### Payment Processors settings

[Here's an example](https://github.com/silverapp/silver-braintree) for how the `PAYMENT_PROCESSORS`
Django setting should look like, for the Braintree payment processor:

```python
# put this in your settings.py
braintree_setup_data = {
    'environment': braintree.Environment.Production,
    'merchant_id': BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID,
    'public_key': BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY,
    'private_key': BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY
}

PAYMENT_PROCESSORS = {
    'braintree_triggered': {
        'class': 'silver_braintree.payment_processors.BraintreeTriggered',
        'setup_data': braintree_setup_data,
    },
    'braintree_recurring': {
        'class': 'silver_braintree.payment_processors.BraintreeTriggeredRecurring',
        'setup_data': braintree_setup_data,
    }
```

If you don't want to process payments yet, just put in your settings file:

```python
PAYMENT_PROCESSORS = {}
```

Current available payment processors for Silver are:

> -   Braintree - https://github.com/silverapp/silver-braintree
> -   PayU RO - https://github.com/silverapp/silver-payu

### Other available settings

-   `SILVER_DEFAULT_DUE_DAYS` - the default number of days until an
     invoice is due for payment.
-   `SILVER_DOCUMENT_PREFIX` - it gets prepended to the path of the
     saved files. The default path of the documents is
     `{prefix}{company}/{doc_type}/{date}/{filename}`
-   `SILVER_PAYMENT_TOKEN_EXPIRATION` - decides for how long the
     pay\_url of a transaction is available, before it needs to be
     reobtained
-   `SILVER_AUTOMATICALLY_CREATE_TRANSACTIONS` - automatically create
     transactions when a billing document is issued, for recurring
     payment methods
